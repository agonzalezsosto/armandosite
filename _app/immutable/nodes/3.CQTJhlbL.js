at this particular moment in time, so I’m going to start rolling the ball in that direction.</p> <p>I see this website - currently quite blank and desolate - and I see a lot of issues. Thankfully, I will be able to change things
as I see fit when I have the time. This is not something that is afforded on other places around the web.</p> <p>A thought might rise - <em>why <em>bother</em> making everything by yourself?</em> Well, if we’re at the point where that question’s being asked,
we might be past the point where answering it is productive to anyone! However, if I had to summarise it, it has to do with curiosity and hope, mostly.</p> <p>Curiosity in the sense of: <em>what can the internet be like? How can I relate to it? How can I use structures and concepts from programming to structure my ideas and work
in an interesting way?</em> Our ideas and work are constantly being shaped by digital tools on the internet anyway - what if we got to shape our own tools? I want to steer straight into zones of curiosity
and not toward zones of <em>desire</em>, <em>validation</em>, etc etc etc</p> <p>Hope in the sense of: <em>is there a different way things can be than what they currently are?</em> I’m not hoping for a specific outcome. I’d actually argue
that having a specific sense of expectation steals a sense of freedom from hope. I just want to give room for things to be different. I don’t know what
that difference may mean, but I want to feed hope by thinking differently in whatever way I can.</p> <p>And also, I want to do a better job at archiving my work. I have been absolutely shit at doing that over the last decade, and I want to fix that.</p> <p>This will be a slowly unfurling project, and hopefully I will keep on doing it long enough to see it develop into a whole new thing.</p>`,1);function m(e){var t=n();i(16),a(e,t)}export{m as component};
